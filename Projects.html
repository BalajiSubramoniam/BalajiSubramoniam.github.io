        <h3> Projects: </h3>
	This is page is the supposed to contain some of my projects and incoherent ramblings.

<h4>Current:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li> <b>Vector Bundles and Characteristic Classes</b></li> This is supposed to be a collection of writings to accompany Milnor and Stasheff's Characteristic Classes, which I expect to be useful at least to the absolute beginner trying to work through the text.
			(UPDATE: Finding the right choice/order of statements I want to prove has been a pain in the backside. I have also retracted a file I had pushed earlier. I hope to have an elaborate document ready in December 2024)
	
		<li><b>TeXing Artin and Mazur's Etale Homotopy </b></li>
	A word of warning that I do not plan to be a 100% faithful to the original text. I might meddle with the notation and terminology so as to make it consistent with modern literature. I might also add some remarks here and there if I find it helpful for my own reference. About 15% of the work is complete and I do not expect to actively work on this at least until December.
	</ol>
<h4>Past:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li> <b>Examples of Infinity Categories</b> (Master's Dissertation) </li> I wrote a Master's dissertation, guided by Prof. Neil Strickland and Prof. Sukhendu Mehrotra, on infinity categories. The beginning aim of the dissertation was to compare locally 0-truncated infinity categories and ordinary categories and simultaneously pick up the necessary elements of infinity categories. In hindsight, the problem in itself is fairly straightforward. However, laying the necessary groundwork to make this statement precise and prove (a few different versions of) the main statement is mildly tedious. <a href"mailto:balajisubramoniam@gmail.com">Write to me</a> if you would like a copy of the dissertation. In my opinion, you might possibly find the draft useful only in the following cases:
		<ol type="i">
			<li> You are interested in the rudiments of the theory of infinity categories (more precisely, quasicategories). However, I must concede that there are many better sources (See for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.2925">Groth's </a> or <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Rezk-quasicats-intro.pdf"> Rezk's </a> notes) that serve this purpose. In particular, I do not prove any of the standard results and in order to make the presentation streamlined, many integral results are left out altogether. </li>
			<li> You are interested in locally truncated ∞-categories. </li>
			<li> You are interested in certain definitions of "(∞,2)-Categories" (Weak ∞-bicategories, ∞-bicategories and (∞,2)-categories) and how they compare. This is discussed in papers of <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/GoodwillieI.pdf">Lurie</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01905"> Gagna, Harpaz and Lanari </a>. The dissertation elaborates on some aspects of this along with a few proofs supplementing the literature. </li>
